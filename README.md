Assignment 2 Snake Game

About: This is a little game I made for my class that involves a snake (black square), food(red squares), and pellet(brown squares).
The purpose of the game is to use the WASD keys, eat as many pellets and raise your score. If a food touches you your score restarts to 0, but there will
be a highscore at the top. Also, if the food eats a pellet or the snake it would grow and add another food entity. The purpose of the game
is to avoid the red squares and eat as many pellets as you can.

This is a project for CMPM20, so anyone can fork off and modify this code. :) I hope you enjoy it.
